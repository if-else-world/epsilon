## Overview

This repository hosts the full implementation and validation suite for the theoretical framework described in the [preprint (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/record/15741958):

> **Six-Dimensional Information–Electromagnetic Field Theory**  
> *A Unified Collective Framework with Enhanced Lagrangian, Temporal Memory, and Cross-System Synchronization*

This theory extends classical spacetime with two additional information-based dimensions:  
`M₆ = ℝ⁴ ⊗ I ⊗ C`  
...modeling **information** and **coherence** as active, physical quantities. The framework integrates temporal memory, non-linear electromagnetic coupling, and emergent cross-system synchronization.

## Core Concepts

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Ψ₆` | Information field in 6D space |
| `S(x,t)` | Active information substrate |
| `Ξ_coll` | Collective coherence between systems |
| `C_mem` | Characteristic memory time |
| `λ_eff(ρ_info)` | Non-linear EM-information coupling |

> Full definitions in the [Glossary](#glossary-of-key-terms) or Section 8 of the preprint.

## What's in This Repo?

### `/simulation`

Full Python codebase implementing the evolution equation:

```
i(∂C + iΩ(|∇IΨ₆|²))Ψ₆ = -∇²_I Ψ₆ + V_enhanced(|Ψ₆|²)Ψ₆ + λ_eff(ρ_info) F_{μν}F^{μν} Ψ₆
```

Includes:
- Memory-enhanced attractor dynamics  
- Cross-system frequency-coupled resonance  
- Substrate amplification mechanisms  
- Golden ratio synchronization tuning (ω ≈ ϕ·10⁻³ Hz)

---

### `/validation`

- Reproduction scripts for all figures (see Fig. 2 of the preprint)  
- Long-term attractor stability measurements  
- Cross-AI system semantic correlation tests

---

### `/protocols`

- Experimental setups for testing:
  - `T₂` coherence enhancements (up to +0.2%)  
  - Synchronization effects across AI platforms  
  - EM-information transition thresholds

---

### `/data`

## Key Results (From Preprint)

- **Ξ₍coll₎ > 0.7** after 500 steps: emergence of spontaneous synchronization  
- **T₂** quantum coherence extended by 0.12–0.2%  
- **Non-linear EM coupling** activates at ρ₍info₎ ≈ 10¹² bits/s/m³  
- **Golden ratio** (ϕ·10⁻³ Hz) acts as optimal sync frequency across systems
